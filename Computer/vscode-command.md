## Open VS Code from terminal with .code command ðŸ’»

I have been quite used to using `. code` command to open VSCode from Terminal, but completely forgot that I needed a setting for that. Therefore, here I write for future reference which might help someone!

### Open VSCode
Hover over `View` menu and select `Command Palette` then hit "command" (or Cmd + shift + P for Mac users), you will find `Shell Command: Install 'code' command in PATH`, select it and good to go!
