# How to migrate Tunnelblick setting to a new Mac

## 1. Install the app
Download the installer from here <https://tunnelblick.net/downloads.html> and install or copy & paste from your backup.

## 2. Set up a configuration file

### Looking for Tunnelblick folder in your back up

Find `/Users/username/Library/Application Support/Tunnelblick`. Note that Library folder is hidden, so you need to press `Cmd + Shift + .` Open the folder and make sure there is `Configurations` folder and a configuration file inside, which has a `.tblk` extension.
