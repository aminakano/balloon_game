# How to convert an XML file to JSON and save as a new file

## 1. Install [node-xml2js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/xml2js)

Create a new folder and initialise npm by typing `npm init -y` on Terminal

Then, `npm install xml2js`

## 2. Create files

- xml_parser.js
- xml file that you want to convert to JSON (sample.xml)

Node implementation is quite simple.

`xml_parser.js`

```
const xml2js = require("xml2js");

const xml = fs.readFileSync("sample.xml"); // where the xml file is located
(async () => {
  try {
    const result = await xml2js.parseStringPromise(xml, { mergeAttrs: true });
    const json = JSON.stringify(result, null, 4);

    fs.writeFileSync("xmltojson.json", json); // whatever you want to name the new file
  } catch (error) {
    console.log(error);
  }
})();

```

`sample.xml` (borrowed from [Microsoft](<https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/desktop/ms762271(v=vs.85)>))
