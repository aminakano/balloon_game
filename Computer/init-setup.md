# How to set up node.js on a new Mac

Setting up a new PC is sort of a pain since I haven't done initial setups for many years. And it is not supposed to be done on a regular basis.
So here I wrote a memorandum regarding how to/ what to set up on a brand-new Mac as a developer in 2020.

## 1. Install XCode
When I ran a command `git --version` and Terminal told like this:
```
xcode-select: note: no developer tools were found at '/Applications/Xcode.app', requesting install. Choose an option in the dialog to download the command line developer tools.
```
So, let's install XCode here: <https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12>

Now let us try `git --version` and the result should be `git version 2.19.0` or something like that.
### ...OK! What now?

## 2. Install node.js & npm
I was disappointed when I ran a command `npm install -g [somepackage]` or `npm --version` and Terminal told `zsh: command not found: npm`.

### Let's start installing Homebrew! üç∫

At Terminal, run `ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"`, follow the instructions and complete the installation. Then run `brew install node`.

If you see
```
Bash completion has been installed to:
  /usr/local/etc/bash_completion.d
```
you are good to go!

Let's run `node -v` and should see its version like `v14.7.0`. Also, run `npm -v` for test and see something like `6.14.7`.

## Congratulations! üéâ
