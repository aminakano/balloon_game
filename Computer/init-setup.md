Setting up a new PC is kind of a pain since I haven't done initial setups for many years.
So here I wrote for how to/ what to set up on a brand-new Mac as a developer in 2020.

### 1. Install XCode
When I ran a command `git --version` and the terminal told like this:
![Error](/images/err_xcode.png)
### 2. Install node.js & npm
I was disappointed when I run a command `npm install -g [somepackage]` and my new terminal told `zsh: command not found: npm`.
